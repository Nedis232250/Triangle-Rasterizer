# Triangle Rasterizer in C++ with the Windows 32-bit API

*Note: Only works on windows*

### What it does:

A triangle rasterizer is a program that takes three vertices in screen space and fills designated pixels in an outline to draw a triangle. If the three vertices are different colors, a process called interpolation interpolates (makes a gradient) out of the lines and you get the signature starter OpenGL/WebGL triangle with 1 red vertex, 1 blue and 1 green which is a great example of it.
